For years I have laughed at silly questions and answers people ask over the internet. My favorite one is "Am I pregant?" Whether it is the internet or real life, we all ask questions like "Am i pegnent? Help!!" Stress, urgency, and plain ignorance may lead us to ask a question that may be worded wrong or have easy to find answers. Learning to understand how to ask a question and understand why people may give you the answer they say.
