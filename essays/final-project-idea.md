<h3> Overview </h3>
 
<h5>"The problem"</h5>
Students face the rising prices of food, and one great way to be frugal is to be aware of deals and taking advantage of them. Since there are so many food places around UH Manoa, it's hard to keep track of what sales are going on or news of what's happening at that certain food establishment.

<h5>"The solution"</h5>
We will create a website that would help notify users of food prices and availiblity on the UH Manoa campus, code named "Food Tracker." Users could login and send in deals they see around campus. Other users can help with the visibility of certain deals by rating them 1-5 stars on how good they are. higher and more rated deals will be featured on the landing page. Deals on subscribed food establishments can notify the user subscribed through email. Admins can monitor the posts by deleting them or editing them from their Admin page. 

<h3> Mockup page ideas </h3>
* Landing page
* User home page
* Admin home page
* Admin edit page
* User account page
* Food tracker post page
* Submission page
* Food establishment list page

<h3> Use case ideas </h3>
* The user opens the site and is greeted with a sign in and sign up button, followed by 3 of the top deals (In cards maybe) at UH voted by the users.
* The admin will login from the landing and then review the posts, if any are deemed inapropriate, he can delete the post from his admin page.
* The user can click into the deals page from the landing without logging in. This is a quick check for deals.
* The user can login from the landing and go to post a deal they saw on campus.

<h3> Beyond the basics </h3>
Some extra features that can be added in the future would be
* SMS Notifications
* Mobile App
* Interactive map, for example mousing over a food establishment on the map will show top deals
* Calendar to show how long certain deals last
