When I was young, I always was fascinated by technology. The allure of colorful screens and infinite patterns of sounds and geography to manipulate was the ultimate playground for me. As a child I would play with many game consoles like the Gameboy and Playstation 2, leading me to my obsession over computers.

Computers held what I loved most, which was video games. I would have to find ways on working the computer and managing the operating system just to play a game. It wasnâ€™t as simple as inserting a disk and playing the game. I had to become one with computers. Learning how to troubleshoot problems in the software of games and computers slowly created a savant in computers. I loved learning about the computer through playing games. I would build a knowledge on computer hardware and software. 

Today, I am 20 years old and still hold the passion for computers and decided to take Computer Science at UH Manoa. As I got older, my interest in computers became more practical and less about games. At first learning programming and software engineering was not fun for me. I looked down at programming and also thought of myself as a failure, because I was not as good as my peers and failing many times. Even through these failures, I still stuck with Computer Science and kept progressing. I became more interested as I was more locked into learning about C++ from ICS 212 and Javascript in ICS 314. I learned to see software engineering in a more engaging light.

I hope to gain creative skills in software engineering so I can truly develop applications and integrate programs in my current and future workplaces to make them better places for clients and workers. I want to experience the passion I felt solving problems for games, and translate the passion into my current work in Computer Science and in the workforce.
