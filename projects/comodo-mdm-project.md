summary: The tech team at Hokulani Elementary School implemented a free MDM service called Comodo MDM to make iPads easier to manage.
---



At Hokulani Elementary School, many of the devices stood on their own, and were not managed via software or the cloud. The tech team decided it was time to implement a management system to track and push apps to the iPads. We have over 50 iPads, and installing apps on them 1 by 1 would take forever and painful for fingers. So we decided to look for MDM's. Most solutions were paid, but we decided on Comodo MDM for its simple integration and quick app management. 

We had to install the app and enroll the iPad profiles individually, but after that, every application can be pushed from any web browser via the Comodo MDM site. Teachers with iPads appreciate this as they can send us lists of applications they would like to have on their iPads and it can be installed quickly and efficiently. Also integration of MDM allows staff to monitor location and security of the iPads making it harder to steal and get lost. The MDM is a step forward for Hokulani Elementary School as it makes managing technology more professional, and familiarizes staff and students with managed devices.
