### Introduction

  Akamai Nook is a project me and my classmates Andrew Yagin and Jiajun Kang developed to help people find study spots. We set out to make a website hosted on the galaxy platform through meteor as our server and mongoDB as our database. Our website was built through the application called IntelliJ Idea written in ReactJS with SemanticUI. The website was built beautifully and fully functions. It was pretty crazy building a website from scratch and watching everything work. It made me feel like a professional in the field. While there were many highs, there were also many hardships due to learning how to work GitHub in a group project and figure out how to properly build the database to fit our functions. 
  
### Functionality

  Akamai Nook was created to help users find and share their own study spots. There are multiple functionalities to our site. The main pages are the landing page, Nooks page, Add Nooks page, profile page, login/signup page, and admin page. The landing page is what users are greeted by. It briefly describes our project and lists 3 of our popular study spots called nooks. There is a list of all the nooks added in the Nooks page. A Nook card has an image of the Nook, the name of the Nook, operating hours, description, and tags chosen. To add a nook you would have to signup for a profile, you are then allowed to add nooks and edit or delete nooks you've added. There is an admin page created for specific users called admins, which can edit or delete any nook hosted on the website. 
  
  A more detailed description on the pages, steps we took to build the site, and user and developer guide can be found on our [github.io](https://akamainook.github.io/) page. I strongly encourage you to take a look, it has tons of information to read up on.
  
### My responsibilities and features

  For Akamai Nook I did most of the mockup and layout for the website to build on. My main features were the Nooks page, My Nooks page, Admin Page, Navigation Bar, and Footer. Most of my time was put into creating data that could be added, edited, and deleted by the correct users. Using MongoDB with meteor really pushed my skills to the tests, and I learned a lot through numerous failures. My main learning point was understanding schemas and subscriptions to store and show data to who I decide. Another was learning to compensate for other group member's design tactics. One example was me not realizing another group member changed the way a class in a css file worked. I was scratching my head for hours until I realized that a class I was using was changed in the css file without me noticing. After finishing most of my code for the site, I updated the [github.io](https://akamainook.github.io/) page to reflect the new changes to the site and rewrote the guides for the new features.
